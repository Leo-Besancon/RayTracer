# RayTracer

This program uses Raytracing methods to render a 3D scene, which are composed of a camera, lights, and objects (spheres, meshes).

This repository contains:
* A .pdf file explaining the results
* An animation (both as a .gif and a .avi) of the resulting render.
* Sources: All files needed to compile and run the program (.vcxproj for VS 2017).
* Images: Raw images used in the .pdf
* Video_frames: Raw images used to create the .gif and the .avi
